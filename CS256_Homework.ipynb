            "We reframe the analysis of progress in AI by incorporating into an overall framework both the task performance of a system, and the time and resource costs incurred in the development and deployment of the system. These costs include: data, expert knowledge, human oversight, software resources, computing cycles, hardware and network facilities, and (what kind of) time. These costs are distributed over the life cycle of the system, and may place differing demands on different developers and users. The multidimensional performance and cost space we present can be collapsed to a single utility metric that measures the value of the system for different stakeholders. Even without a single utility function, AI advances can be generically assessed by whether they expand the Pareto surface. We label these types of costs as neglected dimensions of AI progress, and explore them using four case studies: Alpha* (Go, Chess, and other board games), ALE (Atari games), ImageNet (Image classification) and Virtual Personal Assistants (Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Assistant). This broader model of progress in AI will lead to novel ways of estimating the potential societal use and impact of an AI system, and the establishment of milestones for future progress.\n",

            "This paper studies an acceleration technique for incremental aggregated gradient ({\\sf IAG}) method through the use of \\emph{curvature} information for solving strongly convex finite sum optimization problems. These optimization problems of interest arise in large-scale learning applications. Our technique utilizes a curvature-aided gradient tracking step to produce accurate gradient estimates incrementally using Hessian information. We propose and analyze two methods utilizing the new technique, the curvature-aided IAG ({\\sf CIAG}) method and the accelerated CIAG ({\\sf A-CIAG}) method, which are analogous to gradient method and Nesterov's accelerated gradient method, respectively. Setting $\\kappa$ to be the condition number of the objective function, we prove the $R$ linear convergence rates of $1 - \\frac{4c_0 \\kappa}{(\\kappa+1)^2}$ for the {\\sf CIAG} method, and $1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{c_1}{2\\kappa}}$ for the {\\sf A-CIAG} method, where $c_0,c_1 \\leq 1$ are constants inversely proportional to the distance between the initial point and the optimal solution. When the initial iterate is close to the optimal solution, the $R$ linear convergence rates match with the gradient and accelerated gradient method, albeit {\\sf CIAG} and {\\sf A-CIAG} operate in an incremental setting with strictly lower computation complexity. Numerical experiments confirm our findings. The source codes used for this paper can be found on \\url{http://github.com/hoitowai/ciag/}.\n",
